## Description

Backend API for the Simple Dental Clinic System built with NestJS, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL. This API provides endpoints for managing clients, services, and appointments for a dental clinic.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=dental_clinic

# Application Configuration
PORT=3001

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Database Setup

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database named `dental_clinic`.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

### 4. Seed the Database

After setting up your database, run the seeder to populate it with dental services:

```bash
$ npm run seed
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## API Endpoints

### Services
- `GET /services` - Get all dental services
- `GET /services/:id` - Get a specific service by ID
- `POST /services` - Create a new service

### Clients
- `GET /clients` - Get all clients
- `GET /clients/:id` - Get a specific client by ID
- `POST /clients` - Create a new client

### Appointments
- `GET /appointments` - Get all appointments
- `GET /appointments/:id` - Get a specific appointment by ID
- `POST /appointments` - Create a new appointment
- `POST /appointments/book` - Create a booking (client + appointment + services)

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
